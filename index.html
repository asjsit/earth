            <h1>PLANET EARTH IS FULLY DESCRIBED</h1>
            <h2>Earth is the third planet from the Sun. Located in the Solar System, the Milky Way galaxy. It is the
                densest
                among the other planets of the Solar System.</h2>
            <p>The whole world around us is called the Universe. It consists of galaxies, which are clusters of stars,
                interstellar dust, gas, planets. There are quite a lot of galaxies in the universe. The Milky Way
                cluster of
                stars includes the Solar System. Earth is a planet of the Solar system. In its central part is the
                brightest
                star — the Sun. Space objects are orbiting around it.</p>

            <h1>Undoubtedly, the most famous is the first person to fly into space – Yuri Gagarin. The Soviet pilot took
                a
                huge step for humanity on April 12, 1961, when he reached space and completed one orbit around the
                Earth. It
                is noteworthy that the man whose smile is known throughout the world collected cacti and was fond of
                water
                skiing. Unfortunately, the life of the outstanding cosmonaut ended prematurely during a training flight
                on
                March 27, 1968. On August 1, 1971, the Apollo 15 crew erected a memorial on the Moon called “Fallen
                Astronaut.” The memorial is an aluminum plate with engraved names of 14 cosmonauts, including Yuri
                Alekseevich Gagarin.</p>
                <h2>The word ship was historically used to refer to seagoing vessels crewed by sailors. With the advent
                    of
                    aviation, large passenger aircraft began to be called ships, which are also served by a crew led by
                    the
                    ship’s commander during the flight. When people flew into space, they traditionally began to call
                    flying
                    spacecraft with a crew on board spaceships.</p>
